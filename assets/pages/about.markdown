My full name is **Ganesh** (first name) **Belgur Ramachandra** (last name). My primary area of interest revolves around forward and inverse physically based rendering techniques in computer graphics. Game engine architecture, shader writing, simulation and graphics device drivers form my extended areas of interest. Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.amd.com/en.html">Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)</a> on developing and maintaining open-source, graphics software drivers for upcoming and existing Radeon chips under the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa">Mesa project</a> initiative. My strongest skillsets are in C/C++ and modern graphics programming.

In the past, I have worked on Human-Machine Interface (HMI) software development for the luxury segment vehicles by <a href="https://www.rampgroup.com/casestudy_generalmotors.html">General Motors at Ramp Group</a>, a subsidiary of People Tech Group. As part of the global computer graphics software team at <a href="https://www.mpcvfx.com/en/about/">MPC Film</a>, I developed and maintained the CG hair, fur and feather grooming tool called <a href="https://www.mpcvfx.com/en/site-search/?_keyword=Furtility">Furtility</a>, which earned me several feature film credits. Please feel free to head over to my <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10166225/">IMDB page</a> to see my list of Hollywood feature film on-screen credits.

During my leisure, I will be catching up on films, reading books, technical blogs, working on pet projects or staying outdoors. I love modern and classical western instrumental music.

My personal website here was built to document my work, collaborate with readers and to fulfill my long standing wish to write a website from scratch. My goal is to keep things concise and self-explanatory as much as possible. You will not see any ads, pop-ups or sponsorships on this website. Please feel free to share your feedback on my blog posts and connect with me on Twitter, Linkedin or even via email.
