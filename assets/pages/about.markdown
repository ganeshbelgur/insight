A software developer from Bangalore, India. I’m currently a part of the global computer graphics software team at the Moving Picture Company which has been delivering high end visual effects services for Hollywood movies for quite a long time. Previously, I worked as a developer for an animation studio called Xentrix Studios, immediately after graduating. My areas of interest are relating to game engines, rendering, shader writing, computational geometry, simulation and learning algorithms.

The very first SIGGRAPH Conference that I got to attend was an Asian chapter held at Bangkok, Thailand in November, 2017. Adding to the information overload that I received, participating in the conference has been my best interpersonal experience, yet, with people from a wide variety of cultural backgrounds and influences from different parts of the world.

During my leisure, I’ll probably be catching up on movies, reading technical blogs, working on pet projects or spending time in places with lush greenery - away from the concrete jungle. I read non-fiction novels from time to time with a special interest to know about the lives of great personalities or about cultures and places. Being a lover of orchestral music, I’m a big fan of Ludovico Einaudi, Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Audiomachine and more. I love watching documentaries too!

Alienspline was built to document my work, collaborate with readers and to fulfill my long standing wish to write a website from scratch. My goal is to keep things concise and self-explanatory as much as possible. I believe that sharing knowledge eventually helps me to gain more. Hence, you will not see any ads, pop-ups or sponsorships on this website. Please share your valuable thoughts through comments and messages or connect with me on Github, Twitter or Linkedin.
