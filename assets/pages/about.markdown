My full name is Ganesh Belgur Ramachandra and I'm from Bengaluru, India. My areas of interest include game engines, photorealistic rendering, shader writing, simulation and learning algorithms. I am working at People Tech Group to provide <a href="https://www.rampgroup.com/casestudy_generalmotors.html">Human-Machine Interface (HMI) software</a> solutions for the luxury segment vehicles by General Motors. As part of <a href="https://www.mpcfilm.com/">MPC Film's</a> global computer graphics software team in the past, I developed and maintained the CG hair, fur and feather grooming tool called <a href="https://www.mpc-rnd.com/technology/furtility">Furtility</a>. Over the years, Furtility has been used by several visual effects artists at MPC to create high fidelity CG fur on the big screen. I have received four on screen credits in Hollywood films such as The Darkest Minds (2018), The Lion King (2019), Cats (2019) and Sonic the Hedgehog (2020). As someone who is fond of animals, it was extremely rewarding to help make movies involving computer generated animals. Please feel free to head over to my <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10166225/">IMDB page</a> to take a look.

During my leisure, I will be catching up on movies, reading books, technical blogs, working on pet projects or staying outdoors. My library of books consists of both fiction and non-fiction. I love reading about the lives of great personalities and learn about other cultures. Being a lover of western classical instrumental music, Iâ€™m a big fan of Ludovico Einaudi, Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Audiomachine and more.

My personal website here was built to document my work, collaborate with readers and to fulfill my long standing wish to write a website from scratch. My goal is to keep things concise and self-explanatory as much as possible. You will not see any ads, pop-ups or sponsorships on this website. Please feel free to share your feedback on my blog posts and connect with me on Twitter, Linkedin or even via email.
