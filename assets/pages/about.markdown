{% include image.html url="/assets/images/profile.jpg" caption="Ganesh Belgur Ramachandra" width=300 align="right" %}

My full name is Ganesh Belgur Ramachandra and I'm from Bengaluru, India. Previously, as part of the global computer graphics software team at MPC Film, I developed and maintained the facility's hair, fur and feather generation tool called Furtility. I have received four on screen credits in films - The Darkest Minds (2018), The Lion King (2019), Cats (2019) and Sonic the Hedgehog (2020). Feel free to head over to my <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10166225/">IMDB page</a> to have a look. My areas of interest are relating to game engines, photorealistic rendering, shader writing, simulation and learning algorithms.

During my leisure, I’ll be catching up on movies, reading books and technical blogs, working on pet projects or staying outdoors. My library of books consists of both fiction and non-fiction. I love reading about the lives of great personalities and learn about other cultures. Being a lover of orchestral music, I’m a big fan of Ludovico Einaudi, Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Audiomachine and more.

My personal website here was built to document my work, collaborate with readers and to fulfill my long standing wish to write a website from scratch. My goal is to keep things concise and self-explanatory as much as possible. You will not see any ads, pop-ups or sponsorships on this website. Please feel free to share your feedback on my blog posts and connect with me on Twitter, Linkedin or even via email.
