{% include image.html url="/assets/images/profile.jpg" caption="Ganesh Belgur Ramachandra" width=300 align="right" %}

My full name is Ganesh Belgur Ramachandra and I'm from Bengaluru. As part of the global computer graphics software team at MPC Film, I develop and maintain the facility's hair, fur and feather generation tool called Furtility. Previously, I worked as a pipeline developer at Xentrix Studios, an animation studio specializing in services for CGI animation and gaming projects. My areas of interest are relating to game engines, rendering, shader writing, simulation and learning algorithms.

During my leisure, I’ll be catching up on movies, reading books and technical blogs, working on pet projects or staying outdoors. My library of books consists of both fiction and non-fiction. I love reading about the lives of great personalities and learn about other cultures. Being a lover of orchestral music, I’m a big fan of Ludovico Einaudi, Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Audiomachine and more.

My personal website here was built to document my work, collaborate with readers and to fulfill my long standing wish to write a website from scratch. My goal is to keep things concise and self-explanatory as much as possible. You will not see any ads, pop-ups or sponsorships on this website. Please feel free to share your feedback on my blog posts and connect with me on Twitter, Linkedin or even via email.
