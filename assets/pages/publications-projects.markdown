		<b>Grammar Error Detection Tool</b>:  A noval approach based on NLP for detecting grammatical errors in a text. A technical paper was presented on this approach at the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad which was published by Springer under the title, ’Proceedings of ICCII 2017, Springer - Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing’.<br><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-8228-3_5"><div class="color-button">paper</div></a>

Here is a non-exhaustive list of my projects. You can also check out my Github profile <a href="https://github.com/ganeshbelgur">here</a> for a complete list of my projects.

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Comet</b>: An unidirectional path tracer implemented using the Peter Shirley’s minibook series and the PBRT book. The implementation of some of the advanced sampling techniques are in progress.<br><a href="https://github.com/ganeshbelgur/comet"><div class="color-button">code</div></a>

		<b>Rosary</b>: Rosary is a library of standalone OpenGL applications meant to serve as a playground and a cookbook of recipes at the same time. The library of scenes in the codebase were built over a number of years. Some of the salient features include a first person camera system, loading triangular meshes and materials from disk, Phong lighting-shading model and shadow mapping for directional lights.<br><a href="https://github.com/ganeshbelgur/rosary"><div class="color-button">code</div></a>

		<b>DreamWorks FX Challenge</b>: A simulation of sparks flying in a projectile trajectory that collides with obstacles and splinters. The code runs on a browser since it is a WebGL based application.<br><a href="https://github.com/ganeshbelgur/dreamworks-sparks"><div class="color-button">code</div></a>

	<li>
		<b>DreamWorks Steer Quest</b>:  A flocking simulation of a herd of sheep avoiding static and dynamic obstacles in a scene to reach a designated destination. The algorithm is based on a 1987 paper titled, "Flocks, herds and schools: a distributed behavioral model" by C. W. Reynolds.<br><a href="https://github.com/ganeshbelgur/dreamworks-flocking"><div class="color-button">code</div></a>
